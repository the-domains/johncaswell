# **When I Grow Up**

#### Can't remember much before I was six. I remember being six.

#### I can remember the smell of paintbrushes, filling acres of paper with amazing tasting crayons --- getting my father to show me how he made scribbles look like the real thing. I remember plenty of thatched cottages, cockles, distant rivers and fishing.

#### I'm not sure I can remember being seven.
